# Sprint 8 Market Visualization

This Jupyter Notebook is part of an educational project focused on market visualization using various Python libraries. The notebook demonstrates how to install necessary packages and provides a foundation for further data analysis and visualization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This notebook requires the following Python packages:
- `mysql-connector-python`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `squarify`

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following commands in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade pip
!{sys.executable} -m pip install mysql-connector-python pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy squarify
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Sprint8_MV.ipynb`.
2. Run the installation cells to ensure all necessary packages are installed.
3. Follow the subsequent cells to perform data analysis and visualization.
